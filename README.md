Project Fox Cove
================

This fast project is an attempt to make a personal worklog in order to log daily activities through a CLI. 

## About the name
I just searched for project codenames in wikipedia Intel's codename reference, and scrolled randomly. Guess what, it was there. I got this idea from [@mpj](https://github.com/mpj). You should follow this dude's videos, good stuff to learn.

## Installation
It's probably a good idea to install it globally:
```
sudo npm i -g fox-cove
```

## Usage
Test it:
```
fxc "Hello World"
```

If the output goes like `Logged: "Hello World"`, then it's done!
